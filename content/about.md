Hi I'm Ryan, a seasoned software engineer and people manager with over 20 years of experience in designing, developing, and delivering software solutions. I have a solid background in the Microsoft tech stack, so I'm well-equipped to tackle technical challenges. However, I also recognize that technology is only half of the equation in delivering successful software. That's why I bring empathy and a servant leadership approach to the table, fostering an environment where people feel supported and valued, and are able to do their best work.

Outside of work, I'm a life-long learner and I love spending time with my family. I have a passion for science fiction and fantasy, and I love to immerse myself in new worlds and stories.
