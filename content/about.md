Hi! I'm Ryan. I'm a software engineer with 20 years of experience designing, building and shipping software for all sorts of companies. At those companies I've worn a variety of hats. I've been an individual contributor, an architect and a manager but the hat I'm currently wearing is consultant, working for Prime TSR helping companies modernize their applications and processes and taking it all to the cloud! 

I've primarly worked with the Microsoft stack, going all the way back to the pre-.NET days. Over the years though, I've learned that in order to ship successful software the tech behind it is only half the equation. The other half is working with people inside and outside of the team to make sure they are motivated, enthusiastic and driven.
