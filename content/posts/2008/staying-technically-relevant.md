title: Staying Technically Relevant
date: 2008-11-11

In the comments to my post yesterday (comments meaning the only one I
got), my friend and coworker [Richard
Lowe](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/richard) pointed out that working with
new technology also adds business value.  I have to agree with him. 
Staying up to date with technology, whatever technology you use day to
day, does increase business value. I took that as a given because, in my
opinion, if you don't stay up to date then you become technically
irrelevant and technical irrelevancy adds negative business value.

Negative business value?  Yeah, negative business value.  You actually
becoming a liability to the company by **not** introducing new
technology.  Tool sets, frameworks and programming languages all have an
expiration date (within reason. I know COBOL is still alive and
kicking). When they expire, your company is now in a horrible situation
(especially if that expired technology is running a core business
application).  Staying technically relevant removes that liability.

"So Ryan?  What is technically relevant?"

Glad you asked!  In my opinion there are a few things that every
developer should be aware of right now.  Take note that I didn't say you
should be using, you should know or you should be competent in.  These
are things that should have at least crossed your radar so if somebody
talked to you about it you would have some basis for discussion.

1.) Unit Testing

> Unit testing is pretty much beyond mainstream.  The tools to do unit

2.) Model-View-Controller/Model-View-Presenter

> These patterns have been around a long, long time (so long in fact
> that they have been renamed, but nobody goes by those names yet). A
> lot of web and windows frameworks that are coming out (or in the Java
> world have been out for a long time) use these patterns.

3.) Object-Relational Mapping

4.) Dynamic versus Static languages

> With languages like Ruby and Python being mainstream, C\# adding
> dynamic support (Dynamic via Static) and the addition of the DLR to

5.) Messaging

These 5 things are items that I feel that developers need to have at
least *heard of*. I'm not claiming to be a guru in any of these
(especially
[messaging](http://ryanrinaldi.com/blog/lisle-to-union/lisle-to-union-messaging/)!)
and I'm sure other developers have the 5 areas that they feel everybody
should be aware of.  What technologies am I missing?
