title: Yes my friends, you can charge for free software.

I was reading Slashdot today and on of the posts was "Making Money Using
Open Source Software?" where GamblerZG asks how you can make money
creating Free software.  Yes, it is possible.  Because the FOSS people
use "free" differently than you or I do.

You see just because something is free, doesn't mean it is Free.  This
is a distinction that people in the open source world make by referring
to things as "free (as in beer)" or "Free (as in speech)" (Yes, for some
reason they always capitalize the "Free (as in speech)".)  The
difference is that something that is "free (as in beer)" is something
that does not have cost.  You can download it for free, use it for free
and never will a cent leave you. "Free (as in speech)" is an entirely
different concept.  When they (again, they being that nebulous void that
is the open source/free software movement) refer to "Free (as in
speech)", they are using Free as in Freedom.  They purport that having
open source software gives you more freedoms than closed source. (They
are probably right. (if you think about it (and you care))) 

Anyway, the thing is you can charge for "Free" software all you want. 
You just have to give the source code out.  How long you will be able to
is another story.

Sorry for the random tangent.  Just saw that post and figured I would
chime in.  It won't happen again.
