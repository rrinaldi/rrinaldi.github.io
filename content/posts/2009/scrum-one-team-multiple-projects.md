title: "Scrum - One team, multiple projects?"

At work we are in the process of implementing Scrum (actually tomorrow
is our first Sprint Planning meeting. Really looking forward to it.)

Everybody on the team has read the books on Scrum and we are all very
excited to finally be formalizing our processes but we are in
disagreement about how best to actually implement Scrum.

The problem is that we are a small team responsible for a set of pretty
independent applications.  All of these applications are in various
states:

-   “Done” – These apps only see bug fixes and very small feature work.
    Until the business processes around them change there will be little
    to no work required to maintain them.
-   “Maintenance” – Apps that are recently released. As the business
    adopts them they will require small feature changes and bug fixes.
-   “Greenfield” – Brand new apps that haven’t yet reached 1.0. Lots of
    work.

 

Greenfield apps have more than enough work to fill a sprint. Maintenance
and Done apps, not so much. So how do you fit work on projects into a
sprint if each app has it’s own backlog but might not have enough work
for a full sprint? 

I’ve searched for an answer and I’ve found the following sites that
address it but nobody seems to be in complete agreement.

We have tentatively agreed that we will have one Product Backlog for all
of our projects and a sprint can (and probably will) include work for
multiple projects. We will have one person that will manage the Product
Backlog and will work with the various Product Owners to make sure they
understand how and why the work for their projects is placed in the
Product Backlog.

So to all the Scrum people out there, is this a common scenario? Is one
Product Backlog for multiple projects seem like a reasonable idea? If
not how else can we address our situation?
